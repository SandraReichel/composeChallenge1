I created a app to adopt cute cats with all of my favorite cats in my life.
Everyone needs a cat like my own cat Karli

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I started developing Android in University on Android 2.3, Since then so much development happend for me personally and also
in Android. i want to be part of the next huge step.
I wanted to take part in the #AndroidDevChallenge to try and learn Compose. But of cause also to
have fun and exchange with other developers. I would like to learn more about the performance of Compose,
because my UI seems a bit slow

I'm really proud i create a nice UI complete in Compose just in a few days.
